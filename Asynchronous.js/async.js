// difference between synchronous programming and asynchronous programming js 
// Note - js is a single threded synchronous programming language

// synchronous programming =>

// Synchronous refers to operations or events that occur in a specific, sequential order, 
// where each task must complete before the next one begins, ensuring a linear and predictable flow.

// This means that a potentially complex task may take a while before all its steps are executed and completed. 
// In technical terms, synchronous calls are done in a single thread, and every operation being executed blocks
// that thread for the executionâ€™s duration.


// Asynchronous programming =>

// Asynchronous programming allows tasks to run independently, enabling multiple tasks to be processed 
// at the same time without blocking the main execution thread. Unlike synchronous operations, asynchronous 
// tasks run independently, allowing other operations to continue without being blocked. Tasks that are not 
// dependent on others can be offloaded and executed at the same time as the main operation and then report 
// back the result when they are done.
