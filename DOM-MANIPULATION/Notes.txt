on adding <script> in top = when html file will go to browser and it will parse
(means render html file to browser - parse means browser read it line by line) 
and then load script file first..... and parsing stop here beacause it will load 
full js script and other code of html it is not parsed yet. so on execution time 
js connected to html and it will not get that things those connected to html 
and give execution error.

on adding <script> in bottom = when js add on bottom then it will execute full code 
properly because out html will parsed by browser firstly then js load and all the 
elements of html that used in js will load properly with no technical error.
drawback of this kind is that it is happening synchronously line by line execution
1. parsing      2. js load      3. js execute

third type of writting js is that ----------->  

A technical error refers to an incorrect or faulty procedure, process, or 
implementation in a system, experiment, or operation, resulting in an unintended 
outcome or deviation from the intended result. It can occur due to various factors, 
such as:

Human mistake: A mistake made by a person involved in the process, like a misstep, misinterpretation, or incorrect data entry.
System malfunction: A failure or glitch in the equipment, software, or hardware used in the process, leading to an incorrect outcome.
Procedure deviation: A departure from standard operating procedures or protocols, causing an unintended consequence.
