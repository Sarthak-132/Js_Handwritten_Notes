=>  viewport maximum and viewport minimum 
(vmax) is used as vw and it will work as vw until the value of height is not more than width. 
(vmin) is used as vh and it will work as vh until the value of width is not more than height. 

what is rem and em?
=>  em = parent ka x multiple in parent you have to give that property and then use selector
