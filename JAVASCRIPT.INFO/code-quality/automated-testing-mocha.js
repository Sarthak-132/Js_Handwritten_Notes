// When we write a function, we can usually imagine what it should do: which parameters give which results.

// During development, we can check the function by running it and comparing the outcome with the expected one. For instance, we can do it in the console.

// If something is wrong – then we fix the code, run again, check the result – and so on till it works.

// But such manual “re-runs” are imperfect.
