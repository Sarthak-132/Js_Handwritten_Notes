// what is JS?
/* Javascript is a language that is used to communicate with the computer like we talk to each other in hindi and other languages. 
Javascript is used to create dynamic websites and web applications  */

// Hoisting      output - 5
// x = 5;
// console.log(x);
// var x;

// // another way    output - 5
// z = 5;
// var z ;
// console.log(z);


Hoisting -
In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.
In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared.

// Hoisting         output - undefined
// console.log(y)
// var y = 5;

// Hoisting         output - error = Can not access 'y' before initialization
// console.log(y);
// let y = 5;

// Hoisting         output - error = Can not access 'y' before initialization
// console.log(y)
// const y = 5;


/* ANONYMOUS FUNCTION */
// The definition of the term "anonymous" is "unknown or without identification." An anonymous function in JavaScript is function 
// that has no name, or more precisely, one that lacks a name.An anonymous function has no identification when it is created.

var greet = function () {
    console.log("Welcome to Board Infinity!");
};
greet();


3. difference between undefined and not defined
// =>  not defined means the thing that does not exist
// =>  underfined means the thing that exist but not defined yet


// difference between object and array
// Array :- each element is accessed using its numerical index (starting from 0).

// objects :- An object stores data or holds data in key-value pairs, where each key (a unique identifier) is associated with a value.

// during the calculation the data store in called heap memory - HEAP MEMORY

=> Truthy and Falsy values
5 falsy values: 0, '', undefined, null, NaN, false, document.all rest of these all the truthy values

=> do-while used when at least one time you want to run the code(Loop)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


default parameter -
=> When no value is passed in the function definition, 
   a default value is being set for the function definition, known as the default parameter.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are 2 phases in JS -
=> creation and execution
creation - variable declared
execution - funciton execution and variable assigning
